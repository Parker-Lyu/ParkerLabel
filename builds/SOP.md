# Portable build SOP

All reported sizes use `1 MB = 1,000,000 bytes`.

## macOS arm64

Run from an Apple Silicon Mac:

```bash
./builds/build-macos.sh
```

The script creates a dedicated Miniforge environment at
`builds/.env-macos-arm64/`, builds only the arm64 application, strips eligible
binaries, applies an ad-hoc signature, and writes outputs under
`builds/output/<version>/macos-arm64/`.

The runtime models are not bundled. On first launch they are downloaded into
`configs/pretrain/` beside `ParkerLabel.app`. Re-run the size report after the
first successful launch:

```bash
builds/.env-macos-arm64/bin/python builds/measure_bundle.py \
  --app builds/output/dev/macos-arm64/ParkerLabel.app \
  --archive builds/output/dev/macos-arm64/ParkerLabel-dev-macos-arm64.zip \
  --manifest model-bundle.json \
  --configs builds/output/dev/macos-arm64/configs \
  --output builds/output/dev/macos-arm64/size-report.json
```

Before a release build, set `APP_VERSION`, commit all release changes, create
the matching `v<version>` tag, and build from a clean checkout at that tag.
